The backend is a standalone server-side application that can handle HTTP requests to create a user, list all users, and view, update, or delete a user in the database.

The app also provides authentication and authorization using `jsonwebtoken` and `express-jwt` modules. The API endpoints to view, update, or delete a user are protected using JSON Web Token based authotization.
